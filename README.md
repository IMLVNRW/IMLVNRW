# ðŸ‘‹  Hi there
This account is from the association 'Intergeschlechtlich Menschen Landesverband NRW eV' from Germany. For the most part, we use a lot of open source software. 
Often we have to extend, adapt software or write some things ourselves that we have decided to make this available to you.

I'm a software developer based in Bielefeld, Germany. I enjoy coding open-source projects that solve unique problems. I love combining my hobbies like Digital painting and coding. Y
